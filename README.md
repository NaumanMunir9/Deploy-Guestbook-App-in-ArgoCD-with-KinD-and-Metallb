### Setup Local Kubernetes Environment (KinD) with LoadBalancer (Metallb)

Please refer to the following github repo for setting up a local kubernetes environment using KinD and LoadBalancer using Metallb.

[Create Multi-Node Local Kubernetes Cluster (KinD) with LoadBalancer (Metallb)](https://github.com/NaumanMunir9/Create-Multi-Node-Local-Kubernetes-Cluster--KinD--with-LoadBalancer--Metallb-)

## Project WorkFlow

### Installing ArgoCD

```shell
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

```shell
k get all -n argocd
```

---

### Change the service type of "argocd-server" from "ClusterIP" to LoadBalancer

For the argocd to utilize Metallb, we have to change the service type of "argocd-server" service from "ClusterIP" to "LoadBalancer"

```shell
k edit service argocd-server -n argocd
```

```shell
k get all -n argocd
```

**Now we see that the service type of "argocd-server" service has been changed from "ClusterIP" to "LoadBalancer".**
